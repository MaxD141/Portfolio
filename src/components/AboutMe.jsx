                I am currently a second year undergraduate student studying Computer Science
                at the University of Manchester (2024-2028). I am studying 
                for a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science with Industrial Experience.
                I am a dedicated, aspirational student who has a strong passion for programming and working on
                interesting projects. I am always striving to learn more about my hobbies 
                and improve on my abilities as a programmer.
