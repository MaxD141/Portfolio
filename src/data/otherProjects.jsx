        desc: "Designed and developed a 2D platformer game using Unity. This was created for my A level Computer Science project, and acieved an A* grade. It included writing extensive documentation. The game included several features such as fluent player and enemy movement, customisable settings for accessability, multiple levels, enemies, a local leaderboard, item upgrades, and interactable NPCs.",

        desc: "A University project undertaken to help me become profescient in C++. Was given a poorly made, simple processor written in C++, and I had to implement various refactorings and optimisations, ensuring it was memory safe and functional. This helped me develop both my C and C++ skills as I frequently utilised the C++ standard library.",

        desc: "Created a game inspired by \"Block Blast\", and involves placing blocks onto a grid within a given time in an attempt to fill the lines of the grid. As the game goes on, the time you have to place each block will decrease, increasing the stakes. This application provided an interactable UI, a local leaderboard, optional settings for accessibility, and several hidden features behind input combinations. I ensured to use good programming practices in this projext, such as utilising PEP 8.",
