            Hi, welcome to my webpage!
        <br>
            Here, you can find a brief introduction from myself, along with previews of some of the
            projects I have worked on.
        </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>
            I'm glad you could find this webpage, I built it using HTML and hosted it using github.
            It is one example of the multiple projects that I have worked on over the last few years
            as I have explored my passion for computing more deeply.
            You can navigate through this site using the navbar above.

            hesitate to contact me via the information given at the bottom of each page.
