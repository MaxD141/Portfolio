            <p>
                The first project I worked on was a HTML web project, designed to teach GCSE students
                important content from their course. I decided to create this as I was a GCSE Computer
                Science student at the time, and I used as as both a way to exercise my programming
                abilities and as a method of revision.
            </p>

                Here, you can see the landing page for the website, providing a brief description of the
                site and a nav bar at the top so the user can easily navigate the website. This was designed
                using CSS. The design of this website was inspired by this, as I thought it was a fun way of
                demonstrating how far I have come.
            </p>

        <img class = "revisionImage1" src = "./images/revisionWebsite/Image1.png" alt = "Image of the landing page">
        <img class = "revisionImage2" src = "./images/revisionWebsite/Image2.png" alt = "Image of some content of the websote and the navbar in use">
        <div class = "navBarImage">
            <p>
                This image shows some of the content of the website, describing different specification points
                from the course. It also shows the interactive, drop down navbar in action. This allows users to
                easily specify what they are searching for, and it will take them there instantly. I made sure that
                these lined up with the official specification ,and there is even a link to this and other resources
                found from the 'Resources' part of the navbar.

        <div class = "revisionContent">
            <p>
                This image shows some of the content of the website, including what I thought were the key 
                areas to focus on when revising.
