                Hi, welcome to my webpage.
            <br>
                Here, you can find a brief introduction from myself, along with previews and descriptions of some of the
                projects I have worked on.
            </p>

            <p>
                I built this site using HTML and hosted it using GitHub.
                It is one example of the multiple projects that I have worked on over the last few years
                as I have explored my passion for computing more deeply and aimed to learn and improve as much as I can.
                You can navigate through this site using the navbar above.

                If you have any questions or wish to get in touch, please do not
                hesitate to contact me via the information given at the bottom of this page, thank you.

            <p>
                I am currently a second year undegraduate student studying Computer Science
                at the University of Manchester (2024-2028). The degree that I am studying 
                for is a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Industrial Experience.
                I am a dedicated, aspirational student who loves programming and working on
                interesting projects and I am always striving to learn more about programming 
                and improve on my abilities.
