                SaveCyber is a project I worked on during my first year of University. Working in a team of 4,
                we designed a website targeted at a younger audience with the intent of teaching them basic cybersecurity concepts,
                as there seemed to not be any other sites or resources that did similar things. We employed the use of HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and PHP to create an interactable, engaging website for this.
            </p>

        <div class = "saveCyberPage">
            <div class = "saveCyberPageText">
                <p>
                    An example of the game page of the website is shown here. As the game is targeted towards a younger audience, we decided
                    it would be best to teach the concepts of cybersecurity through an interactive game. There are different levels for
                    different aspects of cybersecurity, such as cryptography and social engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is an interactive nav bar at the top, allowing different web pages to be accessed. 
                    The user has to have a parent log in and agree to our terms and conditions to play, and their username and a hashed password will
                    be stored in our database using SQL.

                        These small samples of code are from some of the parts of this project I worked on.
                        It was my responsibility to create the 'achievements' web page. This page would display various medals depending
                        on how much of a level a user has completed and how fast. To do this, I had one of
                        my peers who was in charge of the database to set up a helper function to retrieve the data, and then I created the code to read this and interpret
                        what achievements to display as completed. I had the achievements stored as a base-4 value, each achievement was represented by a number,
                        displaying if it was incompleted, bronze, silver, or gold. This made the game feel much more interactive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see from this second piece of code, I was also involved with creating one of the levels within the game
                        where the user would interact with an image on the web page and download it to their computer.
                        I had edited the metadata of this image, so that it contained the password to progress to the next level.

                    The first web project I worked on was creating a revision site, designed to teach GCSE students
                    important content from their course. I decided to create this as I was a GCSE Computer
                    Science student at the time, and I used it's development as both a way to exercise my programming
                    abilities and as a method of revision. As this was my first time creating a website, 
                    the only resources used were HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, you can see the landing page for the website, providing a brief description of the
                    site and a nav bar at the top so the user can easily navigate the website. This was designed
                    using CSS. The design of the website you are currently browsing was inspired by this, as I thought it was a fun way of
                    demonstrating how far I have come.

                    This image shows some of the content of the website, describing different specification points
                    from the course. It also shows the interactive, drop down navbar in action. This allows users to
                    easily specify what they are searching for, and it will take them there instantly. I made sure that
                    these lined up with the official specification ,and there is even a link to this and other resources
                    found from the 'Resources' part of the navbar.

                <p>
                    This website's main focus, along with being revision, was to help me learn how to use HTML and CSS
                    effectively. Since creating this, my skills have improved greatly.

                The website you are currently on is my portfolio website. This site is made purely in HTML and CSS, 
                with no external code. I have made use of a lot of the aspects of each of these, such as heavily styalising
                each web page on this site to be satisfying to look at and to not overwhelm the user with information,
                and to format the text in HTML efficiently and effectively. Each aspect of this site was carefully
                considered and implemented.
            </p>

        <div class = "portfolioSaveCyberCSS">

                <p>
                    Here is some of the CSS code for this site. This displays how some of the SaveCyber text is displayed along with
                    some related text in the 'Other Projects' page. I decided to give every element of this page its own
                    class, allowing for heavy customisation possibilities, and making it much easier to go back and change
                    how an individual block of text, image, or group may be stylised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I gave each element a descriptive name so that you can easily distinguish what element it is and where in the site
                    it should belong, as seen with examples such as ".saveCyberPageImage". I have also used clamp() in my font size,
                    allowing for the font to scale easily when the screen is readjusted. This allows for a more dynamic website,
                    and it makes this site available on both mobile and desktop machines increasing accessibility.

                <p>
                    Here is an example for some of the CSS I used to scale this website down on smaller devices, making it work 
                    for mobile machines. This code will, instead of using a grid to store multiple text and images on the 
                    same horizontal line, stacks them on top of each other using a dynamic flex container. This will take effect on 
                    any screen that is less than 768px wide, allowing for the website to be accessed comfortably on both mobile and desktop.
                    Of course, this code is not all final, as I am still creating this website as I write this, so I implore you to check
                    out my GitHub, where this will be uploaded.

                    A small snippet of this projects HTML is visible here. I made use of many of the different aspects that HTML provides,
                    such as br, hr, h1-4, div, img, table, and more. I used each of these in unison to craft the template of this website before
                    I stylised it using CSS.
